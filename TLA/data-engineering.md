## What is Data Engineering?

Data engineering is a set of practices that involves the design, development, and maintenance of systems for collecting, storing, processing, and analyzing data. It focuses on building data pipelines, data warehouses, and data lakes to enable data-driven decision-making and support business intelligence, analytics, and machine learning applications.
