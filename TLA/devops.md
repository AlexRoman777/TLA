## A

- **API**: *Application Programming Interface* - A set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.
- **AWS**: *Amazon Web Services* - A cloud computing platform provided by Amazon that offers a wide range of services for building and deploying applications and managing infrastructure.

---

## C

- **CI**: *Continuous Integration* - A software development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository. Each integration triggers an automated build and test process to detect integration issues early.
- **CD**: *Continuous Deployment* - A software development practice where every code change that passes the automated tests is automatically deployed to production environments.
- **CLI**: *Command Line Interface* - A text-based interface for interacting with the operating system using commands.

---

## D

- **DNS**: *Domain Name System* - A system that translates domain names (e.g., www.example.com) into IP addresses, allowing computers to locate and communicate with each other on the internet.
- **Docker**: *Docker* - An open-source platform that allows applications to be isolated and packaged along with their dependencies, providing a consistent runtime environment across different systems.

---

## E

- **ELK**: *Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana* - A stack of three open-source tools used for centralized logging, log processing, and data visualization.

---

## I

- **IaC**: *Infrastructure as Code* - The practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure resources (e.g., servers, networks, and storage) using machine-readable configuration files instead of manual processes.

---

## J

- **Jenkins**: *Jenkins* - An open-source automation server that enables continuous integration and continuous delivery of software projects.

---

## K

- **K8s**: *Kubernetes* - An open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

---

## P

- **PaaS**: *Platform as a Service* - A cloud computing model where a provider offers a platform with pre-configured infrastructure and development tools for building, testing, and deploying applications.

---

## S

- **SaaS**: *Software as a Service* - A cloud computing model where a provider hosts and delivers software applications over the internet, making them accessible to users without the need for installation or maintenance.
- **SLA**: *Service Level Agreement* - A contract between a service provider and a customer that defines the agreed-upon level of service, including metrics like uptime, response time, and support availability.

---

## T

- **TDD**: *Test-Driven Development* - A software development practice where tests are written before the implementation code. It helps ensure that the code meets the desired functionality and helps guide the development process.

## V

- **VCS**: *Version Control System* - A system that tracks changes to files and directories over time, allowing multiple developers to collaborate on a project and manage different versions of the code.
